Javascript Fundamentals Quiz

The user begins at the start page. Pressing "Start!" begins a countdown timer and takes the user to the first multiple choice question.

Each time the user selects an answer, a new question is rendered. The user is notified of whether they answered each question correctly or incorrectly.

The user's end score is equal to the remaining time. Incorrect answers deduct 15 seconds/points from the score. If the timer reaches 0, the quiz ends and the user is given a score of 0.

Answering all questions will lead the user to an input page. Entering initials when prompted will save the initials and the final score locally so that it will appear on the "High Scores" page
