Javascript Fundamentals Quiz

The user begins at the start page. Pressing "Start!" begins a countdown timer and takes the user to the first multiple choice question.

Each time the user selects an answer, a new question is rendered.

<!-- The user is notified of whether they answered each question correctly or incorrectly. -->

The user's end score is equal to the remaining time. Incorrect answers deduct 15 seconds/points from the score.

<!-- If the timer reaches 0, the quiz ends and the user is given a score of 0. -->

Answering all questions will lead the user to an input page. If the user enters their initials, their initials and final score will be displayed on the "High Scores" page.

<!-- Initials and final scores will be saved locally saved. Locally saved high scores will display on the "High Scores" page until the user chooses to clear them from their local storage (storage exclusive to the user's device). -->

<!-- There are some known (and possibly unknown) bugs. Commented features were unable to be implemented.  -->
